# Building the Valinor Studio Standalone IDE

This repository is a fork of the `microsoft/vscode` source. It includes a custom extension located under `extensions/valinor-studio` which exposes placeholder commands for all planned features. To package a selfâ€‘contained "Valinor Studio" build, follow these steps.

## 1. Install Dependencies

Use `npm` to install workspace packages. The project relies on the versions defined in `package-lock.json`.

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

If the registry is unreachable (for example when the environment lacks internet access) set up a local npm mirror or ensure connectivity first.

## 2. Compile the Extension

The Valinor Studio features are written in TypeScript. Compile them before creating the final product.

```bash
npx tsc -b extensions/valinor-studio
```

If compilation succeeds, you should see JavaScript output under
`extensions/valinor-studio/dist`. You can quickly verify the build by
running the generated script:

```bash
node extensions/valinor-studio/dist/index.js
```

The command prints `Hello from Valinor Studio!`, confirming that the
TypeScript sources compiled correctly.

This produces JavaScript under `extensions/valinor-studio/dist`.

## 3. Build VS Code

VS Code is built through Gulp tasks. To create a distributable for your platform run the task matching your OS and architecture. Examples:

```bash
# Linux x64
npx gulp vscode-linux-x64

# macOS (Apple Silicon)
npx gulp vscode-darwin-arm64

# Windows x64
npx gulp vscode-win32-x64
```

The resulting archives appear in `.build/`.

## 4. Custom Branding

Edit `product.json` if you need the application name or data folders to read "Valinor Studio" instead of the default "Code - OSS". Changing these fields affects the generated packages:

- `nameShort`
- `nameLong`
- `applicationName`
- `dataFolderName`

After adjusting `product.json`, re-run the Gulp build to produce a fully branded standalone IDE.

## 5. Launch for Testing

With dependencies installed and the extension compiled you can run VS Code directly from the repo:

```bash
bash scripts/code.sh --extensionDevelopmentPath=extensions/valinor-studio
```

This starts the editor with the Valinor extension enabled. Use the Command Palette to invoke any `Valinor:` commands. If you built a distributable in step&nbsp;3, you can also launch the binary from `.build/`.
